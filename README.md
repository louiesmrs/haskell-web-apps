# Haskell Web Apps

This repository contains two Haskell-based web applications:

1. **ImageServer**: A web application that uses a custom drawing DSL to render images as PNGs using the JuicyPixels library. It combines Scotty and Blaze for the web interface and demonstrates various shapes and transformations.

2. **Minesweeper**: A GUI-based implementation of the classic Minesweeper game. It uses the Threepenny-GUI library for the interface and includes features like AI-assisted moves and difficulty levels.
